# Analysis-of-the-2016-Presidential-Elections-for-Independent-Parties

# Introduction

This project was made in an attempt to determine the impacts of material conditions on the election outcomes (vote share) for independent 
parties by county in the United States. Given that there has been plenty of research already done on this topic when looking at the main
political parties in the United States (Democrats and Republicans), I wanted to instead determine if worsening material conditions resulted
in more support for third-party candidates.

In order to determine this, we went through some different forms of visualizations to determine the distributions of material conditions,
the geographic spread and so on. Afterwards, we created two models, the OLS multivariate regression model and a regression tree model. 

Although the predictions were slightly different in both models, the general results across both models imply that the opposite happens when
material conditions improve. We interpret this as voters having more free time to pursue their more niche political ideologies when their material
needs are met.
